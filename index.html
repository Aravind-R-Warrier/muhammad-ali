       <div class="intro"> <h2>Muhammad-Ali</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, he began training as an amateur boxer at age 12. At 18, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics and turned professional later that year. He converted to Islam after 1961. He won the world heavyweight championship, defeating Sonny Liston in a major upset on February 25, 1964, at age 22. During that year, he denounced his birth name as a "slave name" and formally changed his name to Muhammad Ali. In 1967, Ali refused to be drafted into the military, owing to his religious beliefs and ethical opposition to the Vietnam War, and was found guilty of draft evasion and 
            stripped of his boxing titles. He stayed out of prison while appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, where his 
            conviction was overturned in 1971. He did not fight for nearly four years and lost a 
            period of peak performance as an athlete. Ali's actions as a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War 
            made him an icon for the larger counterculture of the 1960s generation, and he was a very high-profile 
            figure of racial pride for African Americans during the civil rights movement and throughout his career.Clay was first directed toward boxing by Louisville police officer and boxing coach Joe E. Martin,[19] who encountered the 12-year-old fuming over a thief having taken his bicycle. He told the officer he was going to "whup" the thief. The officer told Clay he had better learn how to box first.[20] Initially, Clay did not take up Martin's offer, but after seeing amateur boxers on a local television boxing program called Tomorrow's Champions, Clay was interested in the prospect of fighting.[21] He then began to work with trainer Fred Stoner, whom he credits with giving him the "real training", eventually molding "my style, my stamina and my system".  </p></div>
